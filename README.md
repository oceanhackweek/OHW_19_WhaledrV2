**The problem**

Outreach, accessibility, reducing workload for researchers annotating large sets of image-based data.

Application example

https://swipesforscience.org/

**Specific tasks**

Refine Megaptera user interface:

  - [ ] zoom controls on spectogram
   
  - [ ] axes labels
  
  - [ ] informative image titles (data, location)
  
  - [ ] 'flail' button
  
  - [ ] fix chat link
  
  - [ ] or combine chat with swipe interface
  
  
Add to tutorial:

  - [ ] add labels explaining spectograms (dolphin vs whale)
  
  
Add to researcher setup guide:

  - [ ] add steps for people with no coding or firebase experience
  
  - [ ] explain S3 buckets, file types and conversions(base64, .json), Travis, git/github, firebase
  
  
Understand backend:

  - [ ] what do researchers get? file types? data?
  
  - [ ] formatting backend results


**Existing methods**

Currently, recordings of whale song are annotated manually by students and researchers. It can take months to get through these recordings! 


**Proposed methods/tools**

Interactive web-based learning app.
